flit-cli

> The Flit command line interface.

Install this globally and you'll have access to the `flit` command anywhere on your system.

```shell
npm install -g flit-cli
```

**Note:** The job of the `flit` command is to load and run the version of `flit` you have installed locally to your project, irrespective of its version. So you should never install `flit` itself globally.
